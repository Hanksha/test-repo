    "comments": "# [Writing to an AWS S3 File](https://docs.torocloud.com/martini/latest/quick-start/resources/examples-package/vfs-methods/)\n\nThis service writes a file to an [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) server by calling `vfs.util.VFSDemo.gloop`.\n\nIt specifies where and how to write the file by passing in the target location of the file (`url`), and which file system options to use (`vfsFileSystemOptions`).\n\n## Invoking the Service\n\nUsing the [Gloop Service editor](https://docs.torocloud.com/martini/latest/developing/gloop/service/editor/) is the fastest way to [run this service](https://docs.torocloud.com/martini/latest/developing/gloop/service/running/). To run, AWS S3 credentials must be provided as [input](https://docs.torocloud.com/martini/developing/services/overview/input-output/) (`s3Opts`).\n\n## Expected Output\n\n### Properties\n\nThis service returns a `content` property which will contain the string written to the file. Its expected value is:\n\n```\nThis is sample content\n```\n\n[Outputs can be viewed in the Console view](https://docs.torocloud.com/martini/latest/developing/gloop/service/running/#outputs). Service outputs can also be viewed in JSON, XML, or in a value tree.\n\n### Logs\n\nLog messages like below are expected in the [Martini console](https://docs.torocloud.com/martini/latest/setup-and-administration/monitoring/logs/#console-view):\n\n```\nINFO  [Martini] Writing the file to the remote location...\nINFO  [Martini] Done writing on the content of demoVFS.txt.\nINFO  [Martini] Retrieved the content of demoVFS.txt: This is sample content\n```",
