Right click the `Databases` above and click New -> Martini Database connection.\n2. Choose `Cassandra` as its type and name it `cassandra-example`.\n3.  Fill up the form with your username and password. (Default values for both the username and password is `cassandra`)\n4. Set the contact point to where your cassandra instance is located (e.g. `localhost`)\n5. Save and start the connection pool.\n6. Execute the service `bigData/cassandra/conf/CreateCassandraDatabase.gloop` to create the database.\n\nAfter following the steps, this service should work as intended. \n\n## Invoking the service\n\nUsing the [Gloop Service Editor](https://docs.torocloud.com/martini/latest/developing/gloop/service/editor/) is the fastest way to [run this service](https://docs.torocloud.com/martini/latest/developing/gloop/service/running/).\n\nOnly the `id` is required by the service as [input](https://docs.torocloud.com/martini/developing/services/overview/input-output/). To ensure successful deletion, use the id `1`. The record with that id is created when running `bigData/cassandra/cql/services/timeuuid/InsertTimeuuid.gloop` or `bigData/cassandra/cql/services/timeuuid/UpdateTimeuuid.gloop`.\n\n\n## Expected Output\n\n[Console messages](https://docs.torocloud.com/martini/latest/setup-and-administration/monitoring/logs/#console-view) like the following are expected when executing this service:\n\n```\nINFO  [Martini] Deleting timeuuid with id 1\nINFO  [Martini] Successfully deleted timeuuid with id 1\n```",
