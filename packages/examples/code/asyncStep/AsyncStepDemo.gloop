    "comments": "# [Using Asynchronous Gloop Steps](https://docs.torocloud.com/martini/latest/quick-start/resources/examples-package/async-gloop-steps)\n\nGloop allows [concurrent](https://docs.torocloud.com/martini/latest/developing/gloop/service/step/concurrent/) and [invoke](https://docs.torocloud.com/martini/latest/developing/gloop/service/step/invoke/) steps to run asynchronously.\n\nIn this example [Gloop service](https://docs.torocloud.com/martini/latest/developing/gloop/service/definition/), we will demonstrate the use of asynchronous [Gloop steps](https://docs.torocloud.com/martini/latest/developing/gloop/service/step/) and how they work.\n\nThis service will execute the steps at lines 3-6 in separate threads. Each step will log their own messages to the console.\n\nAs the service runs, you will notice all steps logging messages at the same time. All of the log messages that will be sent by this service will be prefixed with their thread names. This is to make it easier to see which steps are using which threads.\n\nGloop will not wait for the steps at lines 3-6 to finish before responding to the HTTP request. In other words, Gloop will `return`, and respond to the HTTP request, even though the steps at lines 3-6 continue to run.\n\n## Invoking the Service\n\nThis service needs to be run [from a browser](https://docs.torocloud.com/martini/latest/developing/gloop/service/running/#running-a-service-via-http) or via the [Martini Desktop's HTTP Client](https://docs.torocloud.com/martini/latest/developing/gloop/service/running/#running-a-service-via-http). This is because Martini will always run the service in debug mode, regardless whether you choose Debug or Run to execute. Gloop does not run steps asynchronously in debug mode.\n\t\n## Expected Output\n\nUpon running this service, a response will be sent back immediately with the message:\n\n```\nGloop Service Completed. Please check the Martini logs to see how the Gloop service executed asynchronously. Visit https://docs.torocloud.com/martini/latest/setup-and-administration/monitoring/logs/#console-view to learn more about viewing the Martini logs on the platform you are in.\n```\n\nDepending on how the service was invoked, the message may also be wrapped in an XML or JSON format.\n\nWhile the response has been sent, the service still continues to run in the instance's background. We know this for a fact because of the constant stream of logs being sent. \n\nUpon completion, you should see something similar to this in the [Martini console](https://docs.torocloud.com/martini/latest/setup-and-administration/monitoring/logs/#console-view):\n\n```\nINFO pool-26-thread-8 asyncStepDemo: This step is going to make the current thread sleep for 2 seconds\nINFO pool-26-thread-8 asyncStepDemo: Going to sleep now...\nINFO pool-26-thread-6 countdown: Current count is 0\nINFO http-nio-8080-exec-10 Package is: MartiniPackage [name=examples]\nINFO pool-26-thread-1 exampleProperty is: example value\nINFO pool-26-thread-6 countdown: Current count is 1\nINFO pool-26-thread-6 countdown: Current count is 2\nINFO pool-26-thread-6 countdown: Current count is 3\nINFO pool-26-thread-6 countdown: Current count is 4\nINFO pool-26-thread-6 countdown: Current count is 5\nINFO pool-26-thread-6 countdown: Current count is 6\nINFO pool-26-thread-6 countdown: Current count is 7\nINFO pool-26-thread-6 countdown: Current count is 8\nINFO pool-26-thread-6 countdown: Current count is 9\nINFO pool-26-thread-6 countdown: Current count is 10\nINFO pool-26-thread-6 countdown: Current count is 11\nINFO pool-26-thread-6 countdown: Current count is 12\nINFO pool-26-thread-6 countdown: Current count is 13\nINFO pool-26-thread-8 asyncStepDemo: The thread has now woken.
